🚀 Automating Code Quality with GitHub Actions!



I'm excited to share a CI pipeline I built for a Python project using GitHub Actions. This pipeline ensures every push and pull request goes through a rigorous process of:



✅ Code Checkout

🐍 Python Environment Setup

📦 Dependency Installation

🧹 Linting with Pylint

🎨 Code Formatting Check with Black

🔐 Security Scanning using Bandit

🧪 Testing with Coverage via Pytest

📊 Static Analysis with SonarQube

📧 Email Notifications with Reports



All reports are uploaded and emailed automatically, ensuring transparency and fast feedback for developers. This setup helps maintain high code quality and security standards across the team.



- **Linting** checks code for syntax and style issues to ensure consistency and catch potential errors.

- **Formatting** automatically adjusts code layout to follow defined style guidelines.

- **Security scanning** analyzes code for known vulnerabilities and insecure coding practices.

- **Testing** runs automated tests to verify that the code behaves as expected and meets requirements.
